    <h1>Web Development Notes</h1>
    <p>
        This is my web development notes page. These notes cover web architecture, tools, and generally how it all fits together. My languages-specific notes are currently over on my <a href="https://github.com/johnfmcrae/Notes"> GitHub page</a>, but I hope to migrate them here soon.
    </p>

    <p>
        These notes are my own short versions of topics explained in the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">docs guides</a>.

    <h2>Client-Side Web Development Tools</h2>

    <!-- to do: add a glossary page and link bolded items -->
    <p>
        Modern <b>web toolings</b> provide developers with ways to speed up the development process by automating low-level code generation. In other words, web tooling writes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for you, so you can spend more time on application and web design.
    </p>

    <p>
        MDN groups client-side web tools into three categories:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Safety net</b> - used in the development process</li>
        <li><b>Transformation</b> - used to transform code, for example from some intermediate language into JavaScript</li>
        <li><b>Post-development</b> - used for things like testing and deployment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Let's break down each category in a bit more detail.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Safety Net Tools
    </h3>

    <p>
        Safety net tools are development tools that help keep your code well-formatted, traceable, and neat. Safety net tools include,
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Linters</b> such as,</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://eslint.org/">ESlint</a>, the standard for JavaScript</li>
            <li><a href="http://csslint.net/">CSS Lint</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://webhint.io/">webhint</a> for web development best practices and accessibility</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Version control systems</b> (VCS), of which <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is commonly used for web dev</li>
        <li><b>Code formatters</b> such as <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a></li>
        <li><b>Bundlers and Packagers</b> which do things like <b>tree-shake</b> and <b>minify</b> your code. Examples include <a href="https://parceljs.org/>">Parcel</a> and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a>.</li>

    </ul>
